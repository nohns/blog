Welcome to my new blog! This is a sample post to demonstrate the terminal-inspired theme and Markdown rendering capabilities.

## Features

- Dark terminal theme
- Monospaced typography
- ASCII art graphics
- Markdown support
- Code syntax highlighting
- Tag-based filtering

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## ASCII Art

Here's a simple ASCII art example:

```
  _    _ _       _     _
 | |  | (_)     | |   | |
 | |__| |_  __ _| |__ | |
 |  __  | |/ _` | '_ \| |
 | |  | | | (_| | |_) |_|
 |_|  |_|_|\__, |_.__/(_)
            __/ |
           |___/
```
